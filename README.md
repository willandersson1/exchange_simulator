# Exchange simulator (WIP)
Build and simulate a stock exchange in an object-oriented manner. An exchange processes orders sent to it. Each exchange contains an orderbook for each stock. Each orderbook contains orders at a level; orders include the stock name, price, quantity, direction, and client id. A basic matching procedure matches orders on opposite directions accordingly.
